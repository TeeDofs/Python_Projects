This repository was made to contain all of my personal projects and work. Some of them are incomplete and some are still Works In Progress, but all are my pride and joy for they all represent my journey and effort I have personally put in to becoming a master programmer. I still have a long way to go before I reach that point and doing all these things alone without a mentor or communlty to guide me has been hard, but I will persevere and advance till I attain the rank of Master in various fields. I refuse to settle for anything less. I am what is known as a code unicorn, meaning I am very good and strong at multiple programming fields at once so the projects located in here do not have a specific category or specialization although I did my best to categorize and arrange everything for easy perusal. If you are wondering what those fields are they will be listed below and should also be reflected in my repository.

1. Front End Development
2. Back End Development
3. Full Stack Development
4. Data Base Management
5. UI/UX Design
6. Web Design
7. Programming and Coding
8. SAAS Development
9. Game Development
10. Game Design
11. AI Development
12. Software Development
13. App Development

Ofcourse I am stronger and more focused on some fields than others and those are the fields I listed first but there isn't that much difference between my strength in all the fields listed above which is why I am confident in claiming to be a code unicorn. Feel free to enjoy my portfolio. In the future this portfolio will continue to grow and evolve so just in case you are reading this and it doesn't meet your standards, then do not look down on my baby. This statement was written on Nov 3, 2023 and it has only been slightly over 2 months since I created everything in this portfolio. Imagine what I can do in a year or 5. If you are wondering why it isn't over 2 months, that's because most of my past works were done at college or at a company I worked for and so I don't have access to those works. It is only recently that I got the time and slight freedom to take my own portfolio more seriously.
